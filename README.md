Hi, I'm redcactus5! I'm a mediocre programmer, fan of open source and high level languages, computer history enthuseist, rabbit hole spelunker, and aspiring shut in. I am currently not on speaking terms with lisp and JavaScript. they know what they did. I'm also socially awkward, a bit of an otaku, and enjoy my privacy.
