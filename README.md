Hi, I'm redcactus5! I'm a mediocre programmer, fan of open source and high level languages, computer history enthuseist, rabbit hole spelunker, and aspiring shut in. I am currently not on speaking terms with lisp and JavaScript. they know what they did. I'm also socially awkward, enjoy my privacy, and a walking pile of complexes, but we don't talk about that. I also like cats.
